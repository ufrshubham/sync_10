# Sync:[10]

A 2D game where two players control a single spaceship to collect all the Syncrons to trigger a time wrap and escape

> **Note:** Highly recommended to be played with 2 players.

## Plot

Congratulations, Captain!
You and an extremely qualified*co-pilot (*citation needed) have been selected to pilot the cutting-edge, barely-tested Syncronaut-class spaceship!
There’s just one minor glitch: both of you control the same ship at the same time. Good luck sorting that out.

Your heroic (and extremely underfunded) mission:

- Navigate through asteroid fields, space junk, and highly suspicious gravitational anomalies.

- Collect the legendary Syncrons — mysterious cosmic doodads that allegedly do... something important.

- Trigger a Time Wrap Hyperflux™ and escape before space gets mad at you.

- Outrace other teams on the Intergalactic Leaderboard of Slightly Better Pilots.

Communication, coordination, and maybe a few accidental crashes into nebulae will be your greatest tools.
Can you and your co-pilot achieve true quantum synchronicity?
Or will your ship become just another twirling hunk of space debris?

There's only one way to find out:
SYNC OR SINK.
